# 2D-image-rotation
In this code, we implement the paper 'Unsupervised Representation Learning by Predicting Image Rotations by Spyros
Gidaris, Praveer Singh, and Nikos Komodakis, ICLR 2018' from scratch by ResNet (Residual Network) on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet-200. Our network is a self-supervised network and we train the network to predict the rotations by multiples of 90 and 45 degrees.
